I am a Computer Science PhD student at UMass Amherst, advised by Prof. [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) at the [Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab (IESL)](http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/people). My research interests include scalable machine learning, customizable machine learning, natural language processing, and computational sustainability.

I completed my Computer Science master's degree also at UMass Amherst. I had a lot of fun working with Prof. [Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/index.html), Prof. Dan Sheldon, and ornithology researchers on developing machine learning algorithms to detect and track bird and bat roosts in weather radar data for conservation studies. I also benefited a lot from working with Prof. Mohit Iyyer and Prof. Brendan O'Connor on developing a coreference resolution dataset and a writing assistant system. 

I completed my undergraduate study at UC San Diego with a major in Mathematics and Economics, a major with distinction in Cognitive Science, a minor in Computer Science, and a minor in Philosophy.
